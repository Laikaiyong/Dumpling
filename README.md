# 🥟 Dumplings — Agent-as-a-Service on Solana

Dumplings is a no-code platform that lets anyone create powerful, verifiable AI Agents — integrated with the Solana blockchain — as easily as making dumplings.

Built for startups, enterprises, and Web3 builders, Dumplings allows you to deploy intelligent voice-enabled agents that can answer customer questions, analyze on-chain data, and interact with APIs — all with crypto-native features like token-gating, wallet login, and verifiable AI output.

## 🚀 Why Dumplings?

With Dumplings, you get:

- **Crypto Billing** in SOL or USDC  
- **AI Agent Builder** for fast deployment  
- **Voice Verification** powered by ElevenLabs  
- **Verifiable AI Output** backed by blockchain transparency  
- **Solana-native integrations** like Helius & CoinGecko APIs
